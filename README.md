# CSE 3241 Project

To see the revised ERD and schema, see `doc/CP3.pdf`.

To see the queries used to answer each question of the CP 3 document, see the
`doc/queries` folder. The populated database can be found in `a.db`, and the
expected output can be seen in `doc/expected_output.txt`.

Alternatively, to simply run all the queries, install Python 3 and run:
```
python3 main.py
```
